actually sorting
    how do we sortin ther first place
    we get an array that represents the indexs, and then a new array that is sorted based on value
    loop through new array, bringing those indexs to the front. 
    sorting - private method -> run it after adding a element
    // ill be trying to implement quick sort but we made sure everyone in my group has some sorting algoritim to do, 
    talking about insertion sort
